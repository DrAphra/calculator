# calculator
This is my calculator project for the Odin Project.
The requirements for this project include creating a fully functional, simple calculator using Javascript, CSS, and HTML with emphasis on implementing JS functions. The calculator includes a simple UI.

This project taught me about using classes in JS and implementing functions/methods within the class to handle user input.
